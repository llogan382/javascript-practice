    <h3>What is prisma?</h3>
    <p>It can work with different databases. It just takes the GRAPHQL queries to interact with the DB.</p>
    <p>It takes the DB Schema, and creates all the APIs, based off of the relational data</p>
    <p>The GRAPHQL in here and its queries helps with pagination too</p>
